# ArraySimulator

This is a course assigned project (SE2203) designed to introduce full-stack development. It involves using JavaFX to develop an interactive application, using SceneBuilder to compare the efficiency of sorting algorithms. 
For the back-end it uses sorting algorithms implemented in Java. The application was developed using initially defined UML diagrams, incorporating multi-threading to represent real-time sorting progress
